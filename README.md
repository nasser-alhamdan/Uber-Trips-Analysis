# Uber-Trips-Analysis
So this is how we can analyze the Uber trips for New York City. Some of the conclusions that I got from this analysis are:

1-Monday is the most profitable day for Uber

2-On Saturdays less number of people use Uber

3-6 pm is the busiest day for Uber

4-On average a rise in Uber trips start around 5 am.
